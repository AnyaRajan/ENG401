Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and Its Linguistic Implications
The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization or Harappan Civilization, was one of the earliest urban cultures of the Indian subcontinent. It flourished between 2000 BCE and 600 BCE, with roots tracing back to Neolithic settlements along the Sindhu (Indus) River as early as 7000 BCE.

1. Naming and Terminology
The civilization is referred to by three names:
Sindhu Civilization – Based on the river Sindhu (Indus).
Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) – The term used internationally, where Sindhu is rendered as Indus.
Harappan Civilization – Named after Harappa, the first excavated site, following standard archaeological conventions.
2. Language and Script of the Indus Valley Civilization
One of the most significant mysteries of the IVC is its language and writing system.

a) The Indus Script
The Indus script is an undeciphered logographic or syllabic script found on seals, pottery, and artifacts.
It consists of over 400 symbols, often written from right to left, suggesting an early writing system.
The script is not yet deciphered, meaning we do not have a confirmed linguistic link to later languages.
b) Possible Linguistic Affiliation
Several theories exist about the language spoken by the Indus people:

Dravidian Hypothesis – Some scholars believe it was a Proto-Dravidian language, related to Tamil and other Dravidian languages.
Indo-Aryan Hypothesis – Some propose an early form of Sanskrit or a lost branch of Indo-Aryan languages.
Munda Hypothesis – A connection to Austroasiatic languages like Santali has also been suggested.
Language Isolate – It could have been an isolated language with no known relatives.
No consensus exists due to the lack of a bilingual inscription (like the Rosetta Stone for Egyptian).

3. Linguistic Continuity and Influence
a) Possible Links to Later Indian Languages
Many linguistic elements of Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages could have roots in the Indus Valley Civilization.
Some words in Vedic Sanskrit might have been borrowed from the Indus language, including non-Indo-European agricultural and riverine terms.
The Brahmi script (ancestor of Devanāgarī and all modern Indian scripts) may have been influenced by or developed from an earlier writing tradition, possibly linked to Indus script.
b) Influence on South Asian Phonetics and Writing
The structured phonetic order seen in Sanskrit (as described in Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī) and later Indian scripts may have been influenced by earlier linguistic traditions, possibly from the Indus region.
4. Theoretical and Archaeological Challenges
Unlike Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, no long texts have been found in the Indus script.
The lack of a bilingual inscription (e.g., no "Indus-Roman" or "Indus-Persian" comparisons) makes decipherment difficult.
Indus seals are mostly short inscriptions, limiting linguistic analysis.
