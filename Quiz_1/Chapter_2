Slide_1


1. The Idea of Timeline
📌 Languages evolve continuously—there is no single "beginning" or "end."
Just like how human evolution has no "first human," languages do not have a clear "start date."
A language spoken today is just a continuation of a language spoken in the past, even if it has changed beyond recognition.
Example (India):
Sanskrit → Prakrit → Pali → Apabhramsha → Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.
If you ask, "When did Hindi begin?", it's impossible to give an exact date. It evolved gradually from earlier Middle Indo-Aryan languages.
2. The Unending 'Day Before'
📌 If every language comes from an earlier form, where does it start?
If you go back in time, you can always ask "What came before this?"
No matter how far back you go, there was always a previous stage of the language.
Example (India):
Hindi comes from Apabhramsha (spoken ~1000 years ago).
Apabhramsha comes from Prakrit (~2000 years ago).
Prakrit comes from Sanskrit (~3000+ years ago).
Sanskrit comes from Proto-Indo-Aryan (~4000+ years ago).
Proto-Indo-Aryan comes from Proto-Indo-Iranian (~4500+ years ago).
Proto-Indo-Iranian comes from Proto-Indo-European (~5000–6000 years ago).
👉 If you keep going back, you will never find a "first" language—just an earlier stage of something else.

3. The Problem of "Day One" of Language
📌 When did language start? What was the first language?
There is no clear "Day One" of any language because:
Spoken languages change gradually, without a sudden moment of birth.
Writing systems appear much later than spoken language.
Example (India):
Sanskrit was first written down in the Vedic period (~1500 BCE), but it existed as a spoken language for centuries before that.
The earliest Indian inscriptions are in Brahmi script (~300 BCE), but by that time, people had already been speaking different languages for thousands of years.
So, when did "Sanskrit begin"? It was never suddenly "invented"—it evolved over time from earlier Indo-European languages.
4. The Problem of the Same Language
📌 When does a language stop being the same and become a "new" language?
If two people 1000 years apart speak the "same language" but can’t understand each other, is it still the same language?
Example (India):
If you spoke Old Hindi (~1000 CE), you wouldn’t understand Modern Hindi easily.
But each generation understood its parents—so there was never a "break" in continuity.
This is like the "Ship of Theseus" problem: If you change something little by little, when does it stop being the same thing?
Real Example:
Sanskrit and Hindi share a continuous linguistic past, but no Hindi speaker today speaks Sanskrit fluently.
Hindi and Urdu are almost the same when spoken, but politically and script-wise, they are treated as different languages.
👉 Conclusion: Language change is gradual. If you pick any two points far enough apart in time, they look like different languages, but in between, every stage is just a "slightly changed" version of what came before.

5. The Metaphors: Mother, Sister, etc.
📌 Family tree models oversimplify language evolution.
Linguists describe languages using family relationships, but these are metaphors, not literal truths.
Common metaphors:
Mother language → A language that gives rise to others (e.g., Latin is the "mother" of French, Spanish, Italian).
Daughter languages → Languages that evolve from a mother (e.g., Hindi is a "daughter" of Sanskrit).
Sister languages → Languages that come from the same parent (e.g., Hindi and Bengali are "sisters" because both descend from Sanskrit/Prakrit).
🔴 Problems with these metaphors:

Real mothers and daughters exist at the same time, but languages don’t.
Example: Latin and Italian never coexisted—Latin slowly turned into Italian. So, calling Latin the "mother" of Italian is misleading.
Languages mix and influence each other.
Example (India): Hindi and Urdu borrow heavily from Persian and Arabic, while also retaining their Sanskrit roots. This makes language classification messy.
Dialects complicate things.
Example (India): Bhojpuri and Maithili are often considered "dialects" of Hindi, but they have their own rich history and could be treated as separate languages.
Final Thoughts: How Does This Relate to India?
India has one of the richest linguistic histories in the world, with both Indo-European (Indo-Aryan) and Dravidian language families.

The Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, etc.) descend from Sanskrit and Prakrit, but over time, they evolved so much that they are now distinct.
The Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam) do not come from Sanskrit, but they have borrowed from it due to cultural and historical interactions.
India's language history is an example of linguistic continuity, where different groups of languages have evolved side by side, influenced each other, but also maintained distinct identities.

Slide_2
1. The Same Language: What Does It Mean?
📌 When do we call two varieties the "same language"?
If two people understand each other, we call it the same language.
But over time, languages change—so when does it stop being the same?
Example (India):
Old Hindi (~1000 CE) and Modern Hindi (~2025 CE) have huge differences, but they are still "Hindi."
Sanskrit (~1500 BCE) and Hindi (~2025 CE) have a deep connection, but no one calls them the "same" language.
Maithili and Hindi are close, but are they separate languages or just dialects of Hindi?
👉 Conclusion: Language identity is not purely linguistic—it’s also political, cultural, and social.

2. Variation is Inevitable
📌 No language stays the same forever.
Every language changes—this is a natural process.
Over time, different groups pronounce words differently, create new words, and change grammar.
This happens due to:
Geography (regional accents and dialects)
Social factors (formal vs. informal speech)
Contact with other languages (borrowing words)
Example (India):
Sanskrit borrowed from Dravidian languages → That’s why Sanskrit has retroflex sounds (ṭ, ḍ, ṇ), which were not present in early Proto-Indo-European.
Hindi and Urdu:
Hindi: ज़रूरत (zaroorat) → borrowed from Persian
Urdu: आवश्यक (aavashyak) → borrowed from Sanskrit
They are 90% the same in speech but have different scripts and cultural identities.
Tamil and Malayalam:
Malayalam split from Tamil around 9th-10th century CE due to geographic and political changes.
Today, they are different languages, but early Malayalam was just a dialect of Tamil.
👉 Conclusion: Every language has variation, and over time, some variations become new languages.

3. The Problem of "The Same Language"
📌 When do we stop calling it the same language?
If a language changes slowly, people don’t notice.
But if you compare it across centuries, it looks like a different language.
Example (India):
Old Tamil (~2000 years ago) vs. Modern Tamil (~2025 CE)
Classical Tamil (Sangam period) has very different grammar and vocabulary from modern spoken Tamil.
But Tamil speakers today still consider it the same language because of cultural continuity.
Old English (~1000 CE) vs. Modern English (~2025 CE)
"Hwæt! Wē Gār-Dena in geārdagum…" (Beowulf, Old English)
"What! We of the Spear-Danes in days of yore…" (Modern translation)
Almost incomprehensible to modern English speakers.
Sanskrit vs. Prakrit vs. Hindi:
Sanskrit is still "alive" in religious contexts, but it evolved into Prakrits, which then evolved into Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.
👉 Conclusion: Language change is gradual, but at some point, people stop calling it "the same language."

4. Language Continuum
📌 No clear borders between languages—change happens gradually.
A language continuum is when nearby dialects are mutually understandable, but as you move farther away, they become different languages.
Example (India):
Hindi–Punjabi–Sindhi–Saraiki–Pashto:
A person from Delhi can understand someone from Punjab.
A person from Punjab can understand someone from Sindh.
A person from Sindh can understand someone from Karachi.
A person from Karachi can understand someone from Pashto-speaking areas.
BUT a person from Delhi cannot understand Pashto directly!
Bhojpuri–Magahi–Maithili–Bengali:
Bhojpuri and Magahi sound like Hindi but also have unique grammar and words.
Maithili is closer to Bengali but is politically classified as a Hindi dialect.
Bengali is very different from Hindi, even though they share a common ancestor.
👉 Conclusion: There is no sharp border between one language and another—languages blend into each other over time and space.
Final Thoughts: How Does This Relate to India?
India has one of the most diverse linguistic landscapes in the world, with:

Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, etc.), which evolved from Sanskrit and Prakrit
Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam), which never came from Sanskrit but influenced and borrowed from it
Linguistic continua where different languages blend into each other across regions
India is a perfect example of linguistic continuity:

Sanskrit is still used in rituals, even though it stopped being spoken in daily life.
Prakrits turned into regional languages, but traces of Prakrit grammar remain in Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi.
Dravidian languages influenced Indo-Aryan pronunciation (e.g., retroflex sounds like ट, ड, ण).
🚀 Big Takeaway:
Languages do not have sharp boundaries—they change gradually, and their classification is influenced by history, culture, and politics.

Slide_3



Breaking the Metaphor: The "Mother," "Sister," and the Myth of Birth & Death in Language
Languages are often described using family metaphors—we speak of "mother tongues," "sister languages," "parent languages," and "language families." But these metaphors can be misleading. Let's break them down and analyze why languages don’t follow the same life cycle as biological beings.

1. The Problem with Metaphors: "Mother," "Sister," and "Daughter" Languages
In historical linguistics, we use family terms:

"Mother language" → The language from which others descend.
"Daughter languages" → Languages that evolved from the mother language.
"Sister languages" → Languages that share a common ancestor.
🚨 The Problem?
These terms suggest a biological life cycle, but languages don’t behave like living organisms.

Languages don't have a fixed birth or death date.
They don’t reproduce in the way humans do.
They don’t suddenly "give birth" to a daughter language; they change gradually.
🔹 Example (India):

Sanskrit is called the "mother" of Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.), but this is misleading. Sanskrit didn’t "give birth" to Hindi—it slowly transformed through Prakrits and Apabhramsha.
Tamil and Telugu are "sister languages" in the Dravidian family, but that doesn’t mean they were once the same language and then split like human siblings.
👉 Reality: Languages evolve through continuous change, not sudden birth or family relationships.

2. Humans Have Birth & Death—Languages Do Not
We can write down the Date of Birth (DoB) and Date of Death (DoD) of a person. But can we do that for a language? Not really.

🟢 No Fixed "Day One" of a Language

When did Hindi "start"? We can't pinpoint a single day or year.
Prakrits (~500 BCE - 500 CE) gradually turned into Apabhramsha (~500 CE - 1000 CE) and then into early Hindi (~1000 CE - 1500 CE).
There is no single moment when Hindi was "born."
When did Sanskrit "die"? Technically, it didn’t.
Sanskrit is no longer a first language, but it continues in religious, literary, and cultural contexts.
🔴 No "Sudden Death" Either

Latin is often considered a "dead language," but it evolved into French, Spanish, Italian, etc. So did it really die?
Many believe Sanskrit is "dead," but it still exists in religious texts and even spoken Sanskrit movements.
🔹 Example (India):

Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi are treated as "dialects of Hindi" politically, but linguistically, they are closer to medieval Indo-Aryan languages than Modern Standard Hindi.
Sanskrit is classified as "dead," but thousands still speak and write in it, and its vocabulary keeps influencing modern Indian languages.
👉 Reality: Languages do not follow a biological life cycle. Instead, they continuously evolve and influence new forms of speech.

3. Linguistic Continuity vs. Organic Life
Humans have generations, but languages have gradual transformation.

👶 If humans worked like languages...

A baby is born to a mother.
The mother dies, and the baby grows up as a completely separate person.
They stop being genetically related.
📜 But languages don’t work this way.

Hindi was never "born" from Sanskrit in one moment—it gradually changed through centuries of spoken use.
Tamil is over 2,000 years old, but it has transformed over time while keeping continuity.
🔹 Example (India):

Old Tamil (Sangam era) → Middle Tamil (Chola period) → Modern Tamil (2025 CE)
No break, no "death," just continuous evolution.
👉 Reality: A language can "change beyond recognition" but still be the same evolving entity.



Slide_4

1. Originating vs. Being Related
🔹 Originating → A language develops directly from another through gradual change.
🔹 Being Related → A language shares a common ancestor with another but does not come from it directly.

🔍 Example: Sanskrit & Hindi
Common misconception: Hindi comes from Sanskrit.
Reality: Hindi evolved from Middle Indo-Aryan languages (Prakrits, Apabhramsha), which were also influenced by Sanskrit.
Hindi and Sanskrit are related because they both descend from Proto-Indo-Aryan, but Hindi did not originate directly from Sanskrit.
🔍 Example: Tamil & Telugu
Tamil and Telugu are both Dravidian languages, but Telugu did not originate from Tamil.
They share a common Dravidian ancestor but developed separately.
👉 Key Point: Languages can share ancestry without one directly evolving from another.

2. The Idea of Genetic Relatedness
Linguists group languages into families based on shared origins, like a family tree:

Indo-European (Hindi, English, French, Persian)
Dravidian (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam)
Sino-Tibetan (Tibetan, Manipuri, Bodo)
Austroasiatic (Santali, Mundari)
These families are based on historical linguistic evidence, such as:

Sound shifts (e.g., Grimm’s Law in Germanic languages)
Shared vocabulary (e.g., Hindi "mātā" and Latin "mater" both mean "mother")
Grammar patterns
🔹 Example (India): Indo-Aryan & Dravidian Contact

Sanskrit (Indo-Aryan) and Tamil (Dravidian) are not genetically related, but they have influenced each other heavily.
Tamil absorbed Sanskrit words ("Nir" for water), and Sanskrit borrowed Dravidian grammar patterns.
They are not from the same origin but have become connected through contact.
👉 Key Point: Genetic relatedness means languages come from the same ancestor, but contact and influence do not make them genetically related.

3. Challenges to Genetic Relatedness
A. Language Mixing (Borrowing & Convergence)
Languages mix over time, making genetic classification complex.

🔹 Example: Hindi & Persian

Hindi has Persian, Arabic, and Turkish influences (e.g., "bazaar," "mohabbat").
But Hindi is not genetically related to Persian—it remains an Indo-Aryan language.
🔹 Example: English & French

English has many French words ("restaurant," "government"), but it is a Germanic language, not a Romance one.
👉 Key Point: Borrowed words ≠ Genetic relationship.

B. Micro-Areas: The Challenge of Linguistic Diversity in Small Regions
Some regions have high language diversity in a small area, making classification difficult.

🔹 Example: India (Especially the Northeast & Central India)

Northeast India has Indo-Aryan (Assamese), Tibeto-Burman (Mizo, Bodo), and Austroasiatic (Khasi) languages, all in close proximity.
Chhattisgarh & Jharkhand have Indo-Aryan (Hindi), Dravidian (Kurukh), and Austroasiatic (Santali) languages mixing.
This creates language convergence—languages start sharing features due to interaction, even if they are not related.

👉 Key Point: In micro-areas, languages mix so much that classifying them into separate families becomes difficult.



Slide_5

The Oldest: The Three Senses of Age in Language
When we ask, "What is the oldest language?", we must clarify what we mean by "oldest." There are three possible interpretations:

1. Age Based on Origins or Primitive State
🔹 Misconception: The idea that a language's "age" can be measured from its original or earliest state.
🔹 Reality: Every language is a continuation of earlier speech, so no language has a clear-cut "birth date."

🌍 Why This Doesn’t Work?
Language evolves gradually—there are no sudden breaks.
Unlike humans (who are born and die), languages do not have clear generational divisions.
Every spoken language today is just a developed version of what came before.
🔍 Example: Sanskrit & Proto-Indo-European
Sanskrit is not the "first" Indo-European language—it evolved from Proto-Indo-Iranian, which evolved from Proto-Indo-European (PIE).
Proto-Indo-European itself was a spoken language before it was reconstructed.
Calling Sanskrit "the oldest" is misleading because it is just an attested (written) stage of a much longer evolution.

Slide_6

2) Age Based on Earliest Attestation (Written Records)
Another way to define a language's age is by looking at when it was first written down or recorded. A language that has older written evidence might be called "older" than another.

📜 Example: Persian
Old Persian (Achaemenid inscriptions, 6th century BCE) is older than
Middle Persian (Sassanian period, ~3rd century CE), which is older than
Modern Persian (as used by Firdousi, 10th century CE).
Since these are clearly in the same line of evolution, we can say that Old Persian is older than Modern Persian because we have evidence of it from an earlier date.

🔍 Why Attestation is Not Always Important
Some languages are spoken for centuries before being written down.
Lithuanian was only recorded from 1540 CE, but it preserves many archaic Indo-European features.
Old Church Slavonic (10th century CE) was written earlier, but that doesn't make Lithuanian "younger" in a linguistic sense.
Sanskrit in the Rig Veda is older in attestation than many Indo-European languages, but that does not mean it is closer to Proto-Indo-European than other languages.

Slide_7

3) Age Based on Archaic Features (Linguistic Conservatism)
A third way to define a language’s "age" is by examining how much of its structure remains unchanged compared to its ancestral form. A language that preserves older grammatical or phonetic features might be considered "older" in this sense, even if it was written down later.

🔍 Example: Lithuanian vs. Latin
Lithuanian (first recorded in 1540 CE) preserves many features that resemble Proto-Indo-European (PIE).
Latin (recorded by the 3rd century BCE) lost many PIE features.
Despite being attested later, Lithuanian is sometimes considered “older” than Latin in terms of linguistic conservatism.
🔹 Example Words from Proto-Indo-European:

Lithuanian: "vilkas" (wolf) → Similar to reconstructed PIE wĺ̥kʷos
Latin: "lupus" (wolf) → Significant phonetic change from PIE
📜 Example: Sanskrit vs. Greek
Sanskrit (especially Vedic Sanskrit) retains many archaic Indo-European features that were lost in Greek and Latin.
The Sanskrit case system, verb conjugations, and phonetic structure are much closer to Proto-Indo-European than Greek.
Even though Greek was written down earlier (~8th century BCE), Sanskrit is considered more archaic in structure.
🔍 Why Linguistic Archaicness Matters?
Just because a language is attested earlier does not mean it is more conservative or closer to its ancestral form.
Some languages evolve rapidly (like English, which changed drastically from Old English to Modern English).
Others remain highly conservative (like Icelandic, which still resembles Old Norse).
👉 Key Point: A language can be linguistically “older” if it has preserved many ancient features, even if it was written down much later than other languages.


Slide_8


The Idea of PROTO: A Logical Construct in Historical Linguistics
In historical linguistics, the term "PROTO" refers to a reconstructed ancestral language that is not directly attested in written form but is inferred based on comparative evidence. These proto-languages serve as theoretical models that help us understand how languages evolved over time.

🔍 Key Aspects of Proto-Languages
1) Proto is a Logical Construct, Not a Material Historical Fact
A proto-language is not a language that was directly spoken and recorded.
It is a hypothetical reconstruction made by comparing later languages and identifying patterns.
Example: Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the reconstructed ancestor of languages like Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek, but there is no actual written text from PIE itself.
2) A Historical Linguistic Imagination
Since no one wrote down or recorded Proto-Indo-European, historical linguists use the comparative method to reconstruct it.

🔹 How is this done?

Compare words in related languages.
Identify patterns of sound change.
Reconstruct what the original word might have been.
🔹 Example: The word for "father" in Indo-European languages

Language	Word for "Father"
Sanskrit	pitar
Latin	pater
Greek	patēr
Gothic	fadar
Old English	fæder
By comparing these, linguists reconstruct the PIE root as *ph₂tḗr. No one heard or wrote down this word, but it is inferred based on evidence.

3) Proto-Languages Help Us Reconstruct the Past
Proto-languages provide a "snapshot" of how languages may have looked at an earlier time, based on the languages that evolved from them.

🔹 Example: Proto-Dravidian

Modern Dravidian languages like Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam evolved from Proto-Dravidian.
While there is no written record of Proto-Dravidian, common features among these languages help us reconstruct it.
Words like "water" in different Dravidian languages:
Tamil: nīr
Telugu: nīlu
Kannada: nīru
Malayalam: nīr
Proto-Dravidian reconstruction: *nīr
This shows continuity from Proto-Dravidian to modern Dravidian languages.

Intermediate PROTOs: Stages Between the Ancient and the Modern
Languages do not jump directly from one proto-language to the modern form. Instead, there are intermediate proto-stages in between.

🔹 Example: Indo-Aryan Evolution

Proto-Indo-European (PIE) → Hypothetical ancestor of Indo-European languages.
Proto-Indo-Iranian → A stage before Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages split.
Proto-Indo-Aryan → Ancestral form of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages.
Vedic Sanskrit (1500 BCE) → The earliest attested Indo-Aryan language.
Classical Sanskrit (500 BCE) → The refined literary version.
Prakrits (e.g., Pali, Magadhi) → Spoken forms evolving in medieval times.
Modern Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.).
Each intermediate proto helps us trace continuity over thousands of years.


Slide_9(Handout before this ppt)

Understanding the Concept of "Earliest Languages and Prototypes" in Historical Linguistics
The passage critically evaluates early Indo-European linguistics and its misconceptions, particularly regarding Sanskrit’s role in linguistic reconstruction. Let’s break it down into key points and relate them to linguistic continuity, past languages, and especially India.

1. The Early Mistake: Overestimating Sanskrit's Role
In the early days of Indo-European linguistics, scholars mistakenly overemphasized Sanskrit because it was one of the earliest recorded languages in the Indo-European family. This led to the false assumption that Sanskrit was the "prototype" of Indo-European languages, rather than just one of its many branches.

🔍 Why is this a mistake?
Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is a reconstructed language that predates Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, etc.
Sanskrit is an outcome of PIE, just like Greek, Latin, and Celtic.
Treating Sanskrit as the original source created confusion and distorted linguistic reconstructions.
Example from Indian Linguistic History:
Sanskrit (Vedic) preserves archaic features but is not the original language of the Indian subcontinent.
Dravidian languages, Munda languages, and others predate or coexisted with Indo-Aryan languages.
If Sanskrit had been the "parent," we wouldn’t see the diversity in India's linguistic landscape.
2. What Does It Mean for a Language to Be "Older"?
The passage outlines three different ways in which a language might be called "old"—each with its own meaning.

(1) Age by Origins or Primitive State
No language is truly older than another because all languages evolve continuously from earlier forms.
There is no "first language"; only an unbroken chain of linguistic development.
🔍 Example:
Vedic Sanskrit is not a "new" language in a sudden sense—it evolved from earlier Indo-Aryan dialects that were never written down.
(2) Age by Earliest Written Records (Attestation)
A language is considered "older" if it has written records earlier than another language.
Example: Old Persian inscriptions (6th century BCE) are older than Firdousi’s Persian (10th century CE).
🔍 Why Attestation is Not Always Important?
Lithuanian (first written down in the 16th century) preserves more archaic Indo-European features than some languages attested much earlier.
Sanskrit (Rig Vedic, ~1200 BCE) was written down early, but that doesn’t mean it is the "parent" of all Indo-European languages.
Example from India:
The Rig Veda is the earliest attested Sanskrit text (~1200 BCE).
However, languages like Proto-Dravidian, Proto-Munda, and other indigenous languages in India had likely existed for centuries before the first Sanskrit texts were written.
(3) Age by Archaic Linguistic Features
A language might be "older" if it preserves more primitive or archaic features from Proto-Indo-European (PIE).
Example: Lithuanian (spoken today) retains more PIE-like grammar than Latin from 2000 years ago.
🔍 Example from India:
Vedic Sanskrit is more archaic than Classical Sanskrit.
Some Indo-Aryan languages (like Sinhalese) may preserve older features than Hindi despite being attested later.
3. Confusion Between Proto-Languages and Attested Languages
Many linguists made the mistake of treating the earliest attested language of a group as if it were the "prototype" of all its descendants.
Example:
Instead of studying "Germanic" as a whole, early linguists often treated Gothic (the oldest recorded Germanic language) as the original form.
Similarly, Old Church Slavonic was wrongly assumed to represent all Slavic languages.
Example from India:
Pali and Prakrits were mistakenly seen as just "dialects" of Sanskrit rather than independent Middle Indo-Aryan languages.
Tamil inscriptions from 500 BCE show that Dravidian languages had a parallel and independent history, rather than being later "offshoots" of Sanskrit.
4. The Idea of Proto-Languages and Reconstruction
🔍 What is a "PROTO" Language?
A proto-language is a reconstructed ancestor language that has left no written records.
It is NOT a real historical language but a theoretical model.
Example: Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is reconstructed based on similarities between Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and others.
Intermediate PROTOs in Indian Linguistic History
Proto-Indo-Iranian → Reconstructed ancestor of Sanskrit, Persian, and other Iranian languages.
Proto-Dravidian → Hypothetical ancestor of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, etc.
Proto-Munda → Hypothetical ancestor of the Munda language family (spoken by indigenous tribes in India).

Understanding Linguistic Discontinuity and Proto-Languages
This passage explains an important principle in historical linguistics:

Languages evolve through dialectal variation.
The earliest attested (written) form of a language is not necessarily its direct ancestor but just one of its many branches.
By comparing different dialects across time, linguists reconstruct an older, hypothetical "proto-language."
Key Ideas Explained
Languages Do Not Always Have a Direct Written Continuation
In rare cases, a language is written in two different periods but still remains in the same direct line of descent.

Example: Latin → French (Romance languages all evolved from Latin spoken in the same area).
Example: Old Persian (Darius' inscriptions) → Middle Persian (Firdousi's Persian).
However, most languages do not have such a straightforward written history.

Example: Germanic languages
The oldest attested Germanic language is Gothic (Ulfilas' Bible, ~4th century CE).
Other early Germanic texts include Old High German, Old English (Anglo-Saxon), Old Norse, etc.
But none of these directly evolved from Gothic—they are parallel branches of the same language family.
How Proto-Languages Are Reconstructed
Since written records are often discontinuous, linguists compare multiple dialects to reconstruct their common ancestor.
The diagram in the image represents this process:
scss
Copy
Edit
............A..........  (Period 1)
..........B....................  (Period 2)
..C........D...............  (Period 3)
........................E..  (Period 4)
Here, A, B, C, D, E represent different dialects recorded at different times.
If we only had A, we might mistakenly think it was the original form of the language.
But by comparing A, B, C, D, and E, we can infer an even older, common ancestor language (Proto-X).
The Importance of This Concept in Indian Linguistics
This same principle applies to Indic languages.

The earliest recorded Indic language is Vedic Sanskrit (~1500 BCE).
However, Vedic Sanskrit is not Proto-Indo-Aryan—it is just the earliest attested form of one branch.
Other branches of Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., Prakrits, later Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc.) evolved separately.
By comparing Sanskrit, Prakrits, and later Indo-Aryan languages, linguists reconstruct Proto-Indo-Aryan, which was never written down but must have existed.
Conclusion
Languages evolve through multiple dialects, not a single straight line.
The oldest written form of a language is not necessarily its direct ancestor but just an early surviving branch.
Linguists reconstruct proto-languages (like Proto-Germanic, Proto-Indo-Aryan) by comparing later dialects.
This method applies to all language families, including Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Germanic, and Greek.

Slide_10

What Language Did Pāṇini’s Mother Speak?
The exact mother tongue of Pāṇini is not known, but based on historical and linguistic evidence, we can make reasonable inferences.

1. Pāṇini’s Time and Place
Pāṇini (~5th-4th century BCE) was from Śalātura (modern-day northwest Pakistan, near Gandhara).
This region was linguistically diverse, with Vedic Sanskrit, early Prakrits, and Gandhāri (a northwestern Indo-Aryan language) in use.
The Aṣṭādhyāyī (Pāṇini’s Sanskrit grammar) shows familiarity with these languages.
2. Sanskrit vs. Prakrit Bilingualism
By Pāṇini’s time, Sanskrit was a literary and elite language, not necessarily a spoken vernacular.
Most people in everyday life spoke early Prakrits or regional dialects.
This suggests Pāṇini’s mother might have spoken a form of Prakrit at home but also knew Sanskrit as a high-status language.
3. Nāṭyaśāstra and Language Use
The Nāṭyaśāstra (a text on performing arts, possibly 2nd century BCE) distinguishes Sanskrit (for higher classes) and Prakrits (for common people, women, and certain characters).
If these linguistic divisions already existed in Pāṇini’s time, it supports the idea that his mother likely spoke a Prakrit dialect in daily life but was familiar with Sanskrit.
4. Evidence from S. D. Joshi and Roodbergen’s Introduction to Aṣṭādhyāyī
Scholars like S. D. Joshi and J. H. F. Roodbergen (who translated Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī) point out that Pāṇini includes many Prakritisms in his grammar.
This suggests Prakrit was widely spoken in his environment.
Conclusion: A Bilingual World
Pāṇini’s mother likely spoke an early form of Prakrit (possibly a Northwestern Prakrit or Gandhāri dialect) in daily life.
She may have also had some knowledge of Sanskrit, given its importance in religious and scholarly contexts.
Pāṇini himself was probably bilingual, using Prakrit for daily life and Sanskrit for scholarship.
